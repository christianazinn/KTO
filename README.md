# KTO
A program to Keep Track Of (hence the name) things.  
Developed by Christian Azinn. Currently under rapid development, check back later.  

# NOTES
NOTE: Command-line KTO is currently INCOMPATIBLE with JFrame KTO.  
JFrame KTO should be used by everyone. I don't want to deprecate CL in case it's useful for even one person.
